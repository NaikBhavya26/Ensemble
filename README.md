# Ensemble Learning

Ensemble Learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm where multiple models, often called "weak learners," are combined to produce a stronger model. This repository provides an introduction to ensemble learning, examples of different ensemble methods, and implementation in Python.

## Introduction
Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. The main idea is to leverage the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of each model, resulting in better predictive accuracy and robustness.

## Types of Ensemble Methods
### Bagging
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions. It helps to reduce variance and prevent overfitting. Random Forest is a popular bagging technique.

### Boosting
Boosting focuses on training models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors made by previous models. It reduces bias and variance, resulting in better performance. Examples include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

### Stacking
Stacking involves training multiple models (base learners) and then using another model (meta-learner) to combine their predictions. The meta-learner is trained to optimize the final predictions based on the outputs of the base learners.
